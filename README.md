Here's my solution ... 

Found out about the contest 12 hours before it closed ... and finished up 5 minutes to midnight :D

Not as fast as some of the other solutions since it doesn't use parrallel processing.

This is also my first attempt at writing any Java application, as I've never had any reason to use Java in the past, hopefully not a complete fall down.

Cheers.
